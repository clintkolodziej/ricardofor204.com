Why I'm Running
===============
I'm running for District 204 school board because I want to give a strong voice for equity in achievement and access to opportunity.
---------------

- Belonging & Equity 
  --------------
  LTHS has a diverse student population (~28% non-white) but lacks racial equity. There is an immense achievement gap/education debt (37 â€“ 55 pt gap comparing Latinx & Black students to White students). While working with BE@LT (Belong and Equity at LT), I researched K-12 racial equity plans and led a community activist group in speaking at a school board meeting to ask for action. The next school board should reevaluate the current equity plan and consider passing a resolution which could increase access to data and create measurable goals to aid in belonging and equity of all students. 

- Facilities 
  ---------------
  The current school board committed to air conditioning one school wing, but hasn't yet followed through. I'd like to work with the facilities committee to develop a long term plan ahead of the 2023 bond issuance to improve the school's interior.

- Social Emotional Health 
  ---------------
  LT has a low counselor to student ratio, and it will be important to reevaluate this ratio - especially as we re-enter our school from the pandemic. I am also interested in evaluating assignment of intervention counselors for students transitioning from middle school who we could identify (with data) as needing additional supports. 

- Technology 
  ---------------
  At the start of the 2021-2022 school year, LT will launch a 1:1 laptop program at both campuses for all students. Considering the history of connectivity issues and connection speeds, I would like to work with administration to ensure the tools will be fully operational from day one anywhere on campus. I would also like to increase access to school board meetings, starting with functional video and audio for meeting broadcasts.

- Grading 
  ---------------
  Continue to evaluate the new system using data and seek ways to improve.

- COVID-19 
  ---------------
  While the school board doesn't decide whether students are in-person or remote, once the decision is made the board should weigh in on safety considerations, evaluate viability of substitute and teacher numbers for in-person, and research challenges and successes from neighboring districts. In time, this school board will also be responsible for leading our school out of the pandemic.
