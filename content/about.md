About Me
===============
I'm a resident of Western Springs, father of two young boys, and husband of a teacher. I serve on my synagogue's executive board and have been active for the past two years in attending LT's board meetings. In 2019, I organized community members to speak to LT's school board about the need for air conditioning at both campuses which resulted in a commitment to cool one wing. In 2020, I shifted focus to working with Belonging & Equity at LT, a community awareness group focused on reducing the achievement gap through belonging and equity measures. 

By trade, I'm an Analytics & Insights Manager for a distribution company in Cicero. I plan to use my background in data (MBA + 7 years professional experience) to guide my policy recommendations. I'm also a young Latino who grew up in a poor household; my first-hand experiences can add perspective to equity and race related issues.
